# RecipeRec.com Project Outline

## Motivation and Problems Solved:
Due to the unexpected rise of COVID-19 in Feb 2020, people all over the world had to choose to spend a large portion of their time at home. This phenomenon caused more and more people, especially females, to try various food recipes online to get relaxed during the WFH period. Also, cooking can become a new common topic to help them maintain their social activities and get the sense of belonging.	

According to our observation, we found that users of recipe-recommendation websites drastically increased during the past few months. Thus, we choose the food recipe website as a focus of our project. Instead of covering all recipes online, we will study bakery recipes in particular, since it is by far the most popular category and has quite a lot of data to deal with.
